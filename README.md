# Bachelore-Project
In this project, I did a literature review of robust and inverse optimization and reported them. 
At the end, I applied the models I studied on a real diet problem to get hands on experience with the papers (I created an artifitial data set and used CPLEX to code)
I had read. 
The final report is in Farsi and I got the perfect grade from my professor who is one of the best people
in the field of optimization in my country.
